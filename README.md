# My First GitHub Repository

Welcome to my first GitHub repository! This repo marks the first step on my journey toward personal development and gaining new skills in version control with Git. Throughout this project, I learned some of the core features and commands that make Git an incredibly powerful tool for managing code and collaborating with others.

## Key Concepts Learned

In this repository, I have explored and practiced the following Git features:

- **Branches**: Creating, switching, and managing branches in Git.
- **Merging**: Combining different branches to bring changes together.
- **Diff, Stash, and Tags**: Viewing changes with `git diff`, temporarily saving work with `git stash`, and tagging specific points in the repository's history.
- **Rebase**: Rewriting commit history to create a cleaner, linear project history.
- **Reflog**: Using `git reflog` to track changes and recover lost commits.

## Inspiration & Resources

I learned all of these Git concepts from an excellent tutorial on YouTube. The video walks through each feature step-by-step, making it easier to understand and apply them in real-world scenarios. If you're interested in learning Git, I highly recommend checking out the tutorial!
